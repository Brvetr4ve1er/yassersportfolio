## 🌟 Profile

I'm a multilingual creative communicator with a passion for storytelling, education, and cross-cultural exchange. My journey began with video games like *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*, where I discovered the magic of language and design to evoke emotion.  

Today, I apply that same passion to teaching, helping learners improve their English fluency while building confidence and curiosity. I bring a fusion of digital creativity, patience, and human-centered design into the learning space, ensuring that language becomes a tool of expression—not a barrier.

I also happen to love computers more than sleep
