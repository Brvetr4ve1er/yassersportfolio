### 1. GitHub API Performance
**Issue**: External API calls causing lag
**Fix**: 
- Added 5-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
- Improved error handling and retry logic
- Enhanced caching with TanStack Query (5min stale, 10min garbage collection)

### 2. Image Loading
**Issue**: Large images loading synchronously
**Fix**:
- Added `loading="lazy"` for all images
- Implemented `content-visibility: auto` for performance

### 3. Animation Performance

## Social Media URL Management
All social media URLs are now centralized in `client/src/lib/constants.ts` for easy updating:

```typescript
export const socialMediaUrls = {
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR_LINKEDIN_USERNAME",
  github: "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME", 
  twitter: "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME",
  behance: "https://behance.net/YOUR_BEHANCE_USERNAME",
  dribbble: "https://dribbble.com/YOUR_DRIBBBLE_USERNAME",
  instagram: "https://instagram.com/YOUR_INSTAGRAM_USERNAME",
  whatsapp: "https://wa.me/YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER",
  email: "mailto:YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"
};
```

## Next Steps for Performance
1. Replace YOUR_* placeholders with actual social media usernames
2. Consider implementing service worker for caching
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
4. Optimize bundle size with code splitting if needed
